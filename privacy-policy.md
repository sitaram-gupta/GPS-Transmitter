**Privacy Policy**

Sitaram Prasad Gupta built the GPS-Transmitter app as a Free app.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Real-time Location data if anyone decided to use my Service.

GPS-Transmitter app collects location data to enable real-time location tracking through private code only even when the app is closed or not in use.

This app doesn't get any personal information and save to their database except location data, and this location data also only save in database under the user's permission. Locaton data is only accessbile by the private unique code around the friends and family. but, once the service stoped by the respective users then it will stop to share location even with the private code.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of latitude and longitude in relation to this policy. The Location data that I collect is used for providing real-time tracking through out the private code only. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at GPS-Transmitter unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

**Information Collection and Use**

For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with no any personally identifiable information. The location data that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.

The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.
